Vagrant provider for Cloudify


Prerequisites
-------------
To use this provider, you need to have Vagrant installed - installation instructions can be found [here](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/).  
(Note that the default vagrant-provider used is Virtualbox, which ships out of the box with Vagrant, and the default box is downloaded automatically, so no further installations are required).


##Sample Blueprint
You may download a sample "hello world" blueprint to test and expirement with [here](https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-hello-world/tree/develop/vagrant).
