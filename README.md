Vagrant provider for Cloudify


Prerequisites
-------------
To use this provider, you need to have Vagrant installed - installation instructions can be found [here](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/).  
(Note that the default vagrant-provider used is Virtualbox, which ships out of the box with Vagrant, and the default box is downloaded automatically, so no further installations are required).
